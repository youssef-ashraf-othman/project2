Artificial Intelligence
 </h1>
<p>
<strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> : is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled 
robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. 
The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed 
with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability 
to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. 
Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, 
it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very 
complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems 
or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in 
computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that
 can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday 
 knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and 
 professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial 
 intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, 
and voice or handwriting recognition.

<h2>Applications Of Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Chatbots:</strong>
Artificial intelligence continues to be a hot topic in the 
technology space as well as increasing its inception into other
 realms such as healthcare, business, and gaming. AI-powered chatbots 
 in enterprises will also see an influx of people get more comfortable with 
 how AI can actually benefit businesses versus, say, take away their jobs. 
 From an analytical standpoint, AI can be incorporated into interfaces to change
 how they receive and understand data.

 <strong>Artificial Intelligence in eCommerce: </strong> 
  Artificial Intelligence technology provides a competitive edge to
  e-commerce businesses and is becoming readily available to companies of 
  any size or budget. Leveraging machine learning, AI software automatically tags,
  organizes and visually searches content by labeling features
  of the image or video.
</li>

<strong>AI to Improve Workplace Communication:</strong>
Current business communication is overloaded with content, channels, tools,
 and so-called solutions, depriving individuals (and companies) from hitting 
 targets while also harming work-life balance. Artificial Intelligence will help 
 businesses improve communication internally and externally by enabling individual personalization 
 for each professional, allowing for enhanced focus and increased productivity.

<strong>Human Resource Management: </strong> 
AI and Machine learning are going to drastically and irrevocably change 
how HR and recruitment work in every company and this is going to be awesome. 
In fact, HR is likely to be one of the first areas of business that will benefit 
from AI for two simple reasons. Firstly there are tons of top quality data in HR,
 and secondly, HR is one part of any company that is both essential and yet feels the pressure of time.

<strong>AI in Healthcare:</strong>
In the year ahead, and particularly in the next five to ten years, 
artificial intelligence is going to have a big impact on the healthcare industry
 and the ways in which healthcare related companies utilize AI. Here is a short
 note from Dr. Jeff Dunn, CEO of Redivus Health. Redivus Health is 
 a transformative mobile app used by healthcare providers to prevent 
 medical errors by offering both clinical decision support during 
 critical medical events as well as documenting those events electronically in real time.
